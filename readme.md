# Codocil, a supplement to termocil

Termocil is great. Truly wonderful. I am truly lazy. Termocil wasn't enough automation, so I created codocil to automate the creation of projects.

Point Codocil at the root of your developer directory and all folders that have a known project identifier (excluding node_modules/\*, my goodness could you imagine?) will be given a termocil document. The termocil configuration will have two panes, one for git and one for your server.

Codocil currently only recognizes javascript, though I plan to extend it to work with other languages as well.

code as configuration
